Hello! I am Haohan Guo (郭浩瀚), a PhD student @ CUHK, supervised by Prof. Helen Mei Ling MENG. Before it, I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees from Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by Prof. Lei Xie. Then, I worked as a researcher at Sogou Inc during 2020-2021. My current research topic is deep learning based speech synthesis. If you are interested in my works, welcome to contact me.
